# Housing Repairs Online

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Copilot

Services running in each environment run in separate AWS accounts,However all services are deployed by pipelines from the build and deploy account.

DONT run `copilot svc deploy` or any other copilot command from any other account than `rnd-bnd`. 

Before running any copilot commands run this

1. Define AWS profile env var `export AWS_PROFILE=rnd-bnd`
2. Authenticate with AWS `aws sso login`

## Getting Started

Install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Copy the `example.sentryclirc` file and set the token to from your sentry account:

```bash
cp example.sentryclirc .sentryclirc
```
Globally install azure function tools:

```bash
 npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@3 --unsafe-perm true
 ```
In one terminal run the next development server:

```bash
nvm use && yarn dev
```
In another terminal run the function server:

Copy the `example.env` file and set the values to point to the repairs API:

```bash
cd api/ && cp example.env .env
```

Start the development function

```bash
cd api/ && nvm use && yarn start
```
> if the function doesn't start try switching your node version to 14.0.0 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
